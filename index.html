    <h1>REASON TO VOTE</h1>
    
    <h3>Although Nick  doesn't explicitly refer to young people, a news release accompanying the video says the clip "targets the ever-elusive young voting block."
"You wouldn't let your grandparents pick your playlist. Why would you let them pick your representative who's going to determine your future?" Nick says at one point.
"I understand that it's not always easy to find time to vote on a Tuesday. That's why in every state you can get an absentee ballot, which you can mail in or drop off ahead of Election Day," he said in response to the excuse "I don't have time to vote," adding that one can vote early in many states.
"It's like going to a private Jay-Z, Beyoncé concert," he quips. "Just without Jay-Z and Beyoncé."
Both Nick and his parents,  have been encouraging voting in recent weeks. </h3>
